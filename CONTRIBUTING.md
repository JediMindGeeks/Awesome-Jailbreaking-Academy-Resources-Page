# Contributing Guide

We warmly welcome contributions that enrich the **Awesome Jailbreaking Academy Resources** list. To ensure consistency and quality, please follow the steps and recommendations below.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repository and clone it locally.
2. **Create a branch** dedicated to your change (`git checkout -b my-contribution`). Keep to one topic per branch.
3. **Update the documentation**: add your resource to the appropriate section of the `README.md`, respecting the existing alphabetical or thematic order. Each entry must include:
   - A clear title and a valid link.
   - A brief description (one or two sentences) explaining what the resource offers and who it's for.
   - An optional tag indicating the level (**Beginner**, **Intermediate**, **Advanced**).
4. **Verify your modification**: ensure the link works, the resource isnâ€™t already listed, and it matches the theme of the repository. Re-read your description for clarity and conciseness.
5. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear title and a description detailing the changes. Maintainers will review your contribution and may suggest adjustments.

## Curation Rules

- **Quality over quantity**: only add resources you have tested and would recommend to a colleague. The Awesome manifesto states that a list should be curated, not an aggregator of links.
- **Order and clarity**: group resources by theme and keep a consistent format. Use simple Markdown bullets for readability.
- **No pirated or illegal content**: although jailbreaking explores the limits of systems, this list does not encourage activities that violate licenses or terms of use.
- **References**: favor official sources or research articles over unverified blogs. Commercial contributions must be clearly identified.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before submitting your Pull Request, make sure:

- [ ] The resource was not already listed.
- [ ] The link works and points to the original source.
- [ ] The description is concise and informative.
- [ ] The content follows the curation rules above.
- [ ] You have read and agreed to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Thank you for your contribution! Your participation helps the community progress and maintain a structured augmented memory around jailbreaking.
