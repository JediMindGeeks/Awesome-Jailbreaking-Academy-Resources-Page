# Awesome Jailbreaking Academy Resources

![Awesome Badge](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)

**A curated list of high-quality resources for learning and practicing jailbreaking—the art of circumventing or extending the limits of AI systems, especially large language models.** Each link in this list must be vetted and recommended by someone who has used it and can attest to its value, as stated in the [Awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md).

The goal of this repository is twofold: to provide a rigorous knowledge base for the JediMindGeeks community and to serve as a collaborative platform to enrich that base over time. The content is structured to support augmented memory and cognitive autonomy: each resource is accompanied by concise context, a difficulty level, and, where possible, technical analogies.
