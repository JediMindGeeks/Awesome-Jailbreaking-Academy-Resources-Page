# Awesome Jailbreaking Academy Resources

![Awesome Badge](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)

**A curated list of high-quality resources for learning and practicing jailbreaking—the art of circumventing or extending the limits of AI systems, especially large language models.** Each link in this list should provide clear value and context for learners and practitioners.

The goal of this repository is twofold: to provide a rigorous knowledge base for the JediMindGeeks community and to serve as a collaborative platform to enrich that base over time. The content is short, curated, and should point to high-quality resources.
